There are many pro tips that can help you increase sales on depop. Today we're going to talk about the one with the highest ROI: Increase Your Followers.

I hope that after reading this post, all Debob users who haven't reached 10K followers yet will increase their followers to 10K+ as soon as possible.

Some Debob users already have more than 30K, 50K, or even 100K followers. If you're one of them, just skip the following content. Because for you, increasing followers is no longer the most important thing at the moment.

## Why having lots of followers is important

Well , more followers lead to more sales. Because every time you list a new item, it will appear in more people's feed.

In addition, the more followers you have, the more trust buyers will have in your store, and thus the more likely they are to buy items in your store. There's no magic, just Consumer Psychology.

## How to increase followers FAST

There are many ways to increase your followers, including but not limited to: listing new items regularly, taking eye-catching photos, making your store look more appealing, etc.

However, the fastest way to increase your followers is to **follow as many people as possible**. Because they will follow you back.

This has been proven by many Debob users, some of whom even increase thousands of followers just in the 7-days trial period.

Currently, Debob provides 4 ways to mass follow users.

* Follow buyers of a store
* Follow followers of a user
* Follow following of a user
* Follow likers of an item

Today we'll just talk about the first two ways.

First, go to a store that **sells similar items to yours**, and has a lot of followers and sales.

Second, launch the Debob extension, click the "**Follow User's Buyers**" button to follow users who have bought items from this store (**They are the most likely potential users to buy your items**). Then click the "**Follow Followers**" button to mass follow the store's followers.

Third, once you reach the 7501 follow limit, start mass unfollowing until your following is 0, then go to another store and repeat the above steps.

You can open a separate Chrome Window for Debob to do its job, as shown in the screenshot below.

Please don't use Debob in two different Chrome Windows **AT THE SAME TIME**! We really don't want to put a lot of pressure on Depop's servers.

## Now it's your turn

10K followers is an important milestone for depop sellers, and if you haven't reached it yet, hopefully starting today you'll make it a goal. Mass follow (to 7501) and mass unfollow (to 0) at least once a day, and I'm sure you'll reach that goal soon.

*P.S. When you use the above method to mass follow users, make sure you have a certain number of items in your store. If your store is empty, it will be hard to increase your followers fast, no matter what method you use.*
